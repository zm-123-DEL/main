# The code in this link is used for testing the model.

#The model weights (model.pth) and test sample data (test.npy) are placed in the link https://pan.com.

#test.npy contains 20 test samples, divided into 4 classes with 5 samples per class. Each test sample undergoes similarity selection, where the 15 training samples with the highest similarity are selected from the training set to construct a batch-wise population information graph for testing.
